# Data Scraper
Every data science portfolio needs an example of a decent data scraper! My initial foray into working with a scraper failed, due
to the website's built in scrape resistance (it took me a very long time to figure out why it wasn't working).

I've since found [toscrape.com](http://toscrape.com/ "toscrape.com"), a scraping friendly site where I could get to working on a
scraper that organizes data in a way that's pleasant to the eye. I'll be focusing on working with (http://books.toscrape.com/ "books.toscrape.com")
in this first data scraping example.

## Installation
Working with this scraper will require the use of Python 3 and Beautiful Soup 4 (bs4)
`pip install bs4`
